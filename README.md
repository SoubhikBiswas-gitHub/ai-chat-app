### Trade-Off/Technical Choices

- I used Redux as store management tool to handle all data in one place. I tried to built it in a very simple way.
- Router use to manage navigation and all.
- I used a Simple Express Server To Generate Simulated message.
- Used SASS to Style over the project it's help me to less write style.
- Rect-icon user for icon
- Used some MUI joy component to make more compact full enhanced UI
- The theme design is completely own approach.
